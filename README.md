Assignments of the course 'Reinforcement Learning' at Leiden University AA 23-24 held for MS Computer Science.
The following topics and algorithms are planned to be discussed:

- Tabular Value-based Reinforcement Learning, such as Q-learning
- Deep Value-based Reinforcement Learning, such as DQN
- Policy-based Reinforcement Learning, such as PPO
- Model-based Reinforcement Learning
- Two-Agent Self-Play (AlphaGo)
- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Poker, StarCraft)
- Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
- Meta-Learning, such as MAML
- Brief Summary of Deep Supervised Learning
